Done:
    Add struct to send all data from main through various objects and functions
        Reformat current functions.
    Add code for calculating starting and final state in XY from SD

    Add code for estimating initial velocities and acceleration in SD

Add code for creating a path based on jerk minimized A vector.

Add class / code for cost / fitness function
    This will later include prediction for all other vehicles.

Start with 'ACC' and make sure it works smoothly.

Add transfer conditions to laneChange.
    Make a few 'static' lane changes and evaluate the cost/fitness function for these.
    Change if laneChange is a better option.
